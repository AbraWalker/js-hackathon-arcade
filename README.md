## About

For our Hackathon project, we agreed on recreating an arcade in the form of a website, contributing our own game ideas made using JavaScript.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create fun games with an aesthetic that capitalises on the nostalgia of arcade gaming. For this reason, we have focused on a retro motif, with a colour scheme reminiscent of the flashing lights associated with arcades. 

The website will offer a variety of games that we as developers are passionate about, with high-score tracking available for each game so that users can persevere to exceed their potential. It is important to us that this is both responsive and meets our end goal of what is essentially a miniature arcade, therefore much care has been taken into replicating the arcade experience.

Ultimately, this is a way to test our knowledge of JavaScript as well as our abilities to collaborate, working together to create a cohensive and enjoyable experience.

## UX Design

Our user stories can be found at our project board here. 
By prioritising these stories, we could order our tasks to focus on those most vital with the notes necessary to get started on other cool potential features if desired. 

### Wireframes

Our wireframes were created using Balsamiq, with the colour palette replicated in the program to test that it met our expectations before committing to it.

### Aesthetic

We decided to design the website to capture the feeling of nostalgia many of us associate with arcades, using a retro or 'old school' motif to draw on any positive memories our users may have.

Our colour palette was selected with neon colours, tested against dark backgrounds to ensure they appeared vibrant. We chose to use a handful of colours to make up the general framework as well as picked a colour each to associate with our corresponding games. We hope through these decisions, users will find our website just as captivating as we find arcades.
